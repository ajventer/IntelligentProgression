	completedMessage = Congratulations! Geostationary satellites are a very important part of a complete communications network. This type of orbit allows specific areas on the globe to be targeted since the satellite stays above the same area at all times.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Information:</color></b> Syncom 3 was the first geostationary satellite. It was an experimental geosynchronous communications satellite placed over the equator at 180 degrees longitude in the Pacific Ocean. The satellite provided live television coverage of the 1964 Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan and conducted various communications tests. Operations were turned over to the Department of Defense on 1 January 1965, Syncom 3 was to prove useful in the DoD's Vietnam communications.
